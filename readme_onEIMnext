Readme on EIMnext method

The EIMnext method is always paired up with EIM_eval type method 
EIMnext needs EIM_eval as objective function to search for next point
 
EIM_eval is seperated for plot later purpose 

* Problems that triggered investigation
For oodace which seed generate problem
init 5 points, iteration  50
(1) rastrigin(1, 1), seed 3, from iteration 36, unique check fails, dace keep proposing the same point 
(2) shekel(1, 1), seed 3, approximation function goes wrong from time to time
(3) shekel_curve(1, 1), seed 2, approximation function fail to generate smooth curve since iteration 26 

* For dace which seed generates problem
(1) rastrigin, seed 1, multiple fails in approximation over iteration.
    saved the last iteration (54 points) and test on the given approximation code to check the rebuild, 
	same as in the general code
(2) shekel_curve(1, 1), seed 1,  start from iteration 12, look stuck in local minimum
				        seed 2,   fail to generate smooth curve at a few iterations, can recover from there
(3)	shekel(1, 1), seed 2, start from iteration 20, can fail in approximation, but can recover from iteration
(4) Shekel_curve(1, 1), seed 2, iteration 6, check EA search 

* Solution
Solution: for dace training, using multiple restart method. Multiple restart with randomly initialized theta 
		  in method Train_DACE.m
		  
* Conclusion
Problems of failing approximation is largely solved
Problem of stucking in local region is automatically fixed when EI landscape is too sharp, global search 
fails to identify that sharp spike, consequently escape local region.
