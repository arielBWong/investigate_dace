examples of oodace default setting problem
use problem: prob = 'Shekel_curve()'
(---optional) in matlab add path: Utility, problems, ooDACE-1.4, ND_sort, globalsolver
run parameter_ei.m to set parameters: 	
									param_ei.init_size = 5; 
								    param_ei.iter_size = 50; 
run: believerdemo.m

behaviour:
by the 26th iteration,  the approximation starts to deteriorate 

* Potential trap in Train_DACE method
hyperparameter training inialize theta range [lb, ub] as in line: 
Fit_DACE(X, Y, @Regpoly0, @Corrgauss, theta_start', lb, ub);

How lb ub is decided? X is training data

range = minmax(X');
lb    = max(1e-6,range(:,1));
ub    = range(:,2);

Problem is if lb is 1e-6 or beyond
              ub > lb, 
		   then 
			  Training data CANNOT have a range smaller than 0
